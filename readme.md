Who doesn't like exploring for a new challenge? I'm a robotics engineer by day, and at night still crackin' away, buring that midnight oil on something new (_since the mid 90s_).

> Always innovate & never loose that steam!

Check out the code samples badged as `Learn` and `Test`. These exercises provides a code-first crash course into their respective topics. The library keeps growing & it isn't going to stop!

Since my focus is primarily on projects/family, the blog, [SuessLabs.com](https://www.suesslabs.com) gets updated when time allows for it. Soon, you'll find verbose tips and tricks with a focus on mobile development using C#, Arduino, [Xamarin (MAUI)](https://github.com/dotnet/maui), [PrismLibrary](https://github.com/PrismLibrary/Prism), and [Prism.Avalonia](https://github.com/AvaloniaCommunity/Prism.Avalonia). If you can't wait for an article, browse the repos here on GitHub!
