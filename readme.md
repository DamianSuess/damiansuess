# Hi there I'm Damian! ðŸ¤¸

Founder of [Xeno Innovations](https://xenoinc.com) and [Suess Labs](https://www.suesslabs.com) and avocate for all nerdy things ðŸ’» Who doesn't like exploring for a new challenge. I'm a robotics engineer by day, and at night still crackin' away buring that midnight oil on something new (_since the mid 90s_).

    One should always innovate & never loose that steam

Check out the code samples `Learn.` and `Test.` exercises which provides a code-only crash course into tech topics. The library keeps growing & it isn't going to stop!

Since my focus is primarily on projects/family, the blog, [SuessLabs.com](https://www.suesslabs.com) gets updated when time allows for it. Soon, you'll find verbose tips and tricks with a focus on mobile development using C#, Arduino, [Xamarin (MAUI)](https://github.com/dotnet/maui), [PrismLibrary](https://github.com/PrismLibrary/Prism), and [Prism.Avalonia](https://github.com/AvaloniaCommunity/Prism.Avalonia). If you can't wait for an article, browse the repos here on GitHub!
