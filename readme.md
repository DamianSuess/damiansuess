# Hi there I'm Damian! ü§∏ üê±‚Äçüë§

Founder of [Xeno Innovations, Inc.](https://xenoinc.com) ([git](https://github.com/XenoInc)) and [Suess Labs](https://www.suesslabs.com) ([git](https://github.com/SuessLabs)) consulting. As an advocate for all things nerdy, my GitHub repos cover topics such as cross-platform mobile, embedded devices, Prism.Avalonia, VS Linux Debugger, Linux Bluetooth for C#, and more!

Who doesn't like exploring for a new challenge? I'm a robotics engineer by day, and at night crackin' away, burning that midnight oil on something new (_since the mid-90s_).

> Always innovate & never lose that steam!

Check out the code samples badged as `Learn` and `Test`. These exercises provide a code-first crash course into their respective topics. The library keeps growing & it isn't going to stop!

Since my focus is primarily on projects/family, the blog, [SuessLabs.com](https://www.suesslabs.com) gets updated when time allows. My repos aim to provide verbose tips and tricks with a focus on mobile development.  You'll find a lot using C# or C++, most notably, [Prism.Avalonia](https://github.com/AvaloniaCommunity/Prism.Avalonia), [Visual Studio Linux Debugger](https://github.com/SuessLabs/VsLinuxDebug), [Linux Bluetooth](https://github.com/SuessLabs/Linux.Bluetooth), [.NET MAUI (Xamarin)](https://github.com/dotnet/maui), and [PrismLibrary](https://github.com/PrismLibrary/Prism). If you can't wait for an article, browse the repos here on GitHub!
